    "You can see how it simplifies your life by creating simple shortcuts of bash commands.\n",
    "It even allows to set dependencies between commands, \n",
    "like in the example above where `celery` task is not run until `watchdog` is installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "::: {.callout-note title=\"What is .PHONY?\" collapse=true appearance=\"simple\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "But you can already notice some strange things: what is that `.PHONY` thing?\n",
    "And why does it have `*` in it?\n",
    "The key is rooted in the original purpose of Makefiles - to compile C programs.\n",
    "When you build some C program, you need to specify all the files that are needed for building.\n",
    "So you write smth like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Makefile\n",
    "\n",
    "prog: file1.o file2.o file3.o\n",
    "\tgcc -o prog file1.o file2.o file3.o\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "The case is, each building target is always a file or directory.\n",
    "If dependency target file already exists - you don't need to rerun corresponding command,\n",
    "and make skips it.\n",
    "\n",
    "But when you're using Makefile just for arbitrary commandline shortcuts, this behavior is usually unwanted.\n",
    "\n",
    "`.PHONY` is used to tell `make` that targets listed there are not real files, but just labels.\n",
    "So `make lint` will always run `lint` command, even if there is a file named `lint` in the current directory.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "More information on this and other tips of adapting Makefiles for Python projects you can find [here](https://blog.mathieu-leplatre.info/tips-for-your-makefile-with-python.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another example of a bit more advanced Makefile target with parameter:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Makefile\n",
    "\n",
    "list_all_tests:\n",
    "\tfind . -name '*.py' -not -path \"*venv*\" | grep test | sed 's|\\.py||g' | sed 's|^\\./||g' | sed 's|/|.|g'\n",

    "\tmake list_all_tests | grep $(s) | xargs --no-run-if-empty --verbose ./manage.py test --keepdb --failfast\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, `test` **target has a parameter** `s`, which is a substring of the test name you want to run.\n",
    "E.g., in order to find and run all test related to authentication, assuming their filenames contain `auth`, \n",
    "you need to call `make test s=auth`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Just\n",
    "\n",
    "Just is a simpler and more modern alternative to Make.\n",
    "It also avoids some of its pitfalls, making it useful for a broader range of tasks.\n",
    "But basic syntax is the same, you can just copy it from `Makefile` to `justfile` and simple commands will work out of the box.\n",
    "\n",
    "It has a good [documentaion](https://just.systems/man/en/).\n",
    "\n",
    "::: {.callout-tip collapse=false appearance=\"simple\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "## Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "E.g., this is how to use parameters for our test example above:\n",

    "```Makefile\n",

    "list_all_tests:\n",
    "\tfind . -name '*.py' -not -path \"*venv*\" | grep test | sed 's|\\.py||g' | sed 's|^\\./||g' | sed 's|/|.|g'\n",

    "\tmake list_all_tests | grep {{substring}} | xargs --no-run-if-empty --verbose ./manage.py test --keepdb --failfast\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "And to run it you need to call `just test auth`. \n",
    "Note, that you should not write the name of the parameter when invoking the command, which would be annoying in case of full parameter name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameters can have **default values**. This is how I use it to create new draft posts:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```Makefile\n",
    "default_ext := 'ipynb'\n",
    "\n",
    "draft name ext=default_ext: # just first param \n",

    "\tcp -n _examples/new_draft.{{ext}} posts/{{name}}/{{name}}.{{ext}}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And to run it:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "just draft my-new-post # default extension is ipynb\n",
    "just draft my-new-post md # markdown is used\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "## Env files\n",
